    Final keyword: unchangeable
        Variables : can not be reassigned
            - The value of that variable becomes unchangeable
            - When you instance or static variable that they are final usually instance and static variable
            have default value, there is no default value for Final
            - For any final value there is no default value, you have to assign some thing.
            - You can assign it only ONE time, and you need to make sure that it is initialized before you use it.
            - When you have final instance variable you can initialize it within the constructor
            - Once you set the final value you can never set it again
            - When you have final static variable you can assign it directly or you can initialize within the static block
            - so whichever a variable final, it can not be reassigned

        Methods : can not be overridden
            - Final means unchangeable, when the method is final it indicates that specific implementation
            of the method is unchangeable. (overriding it is about giving different implementation)
            - any method can be overloaded

        Classes : can not be inherited (can not be parent)
            - can not be super/sub class


    There are 2 category of Exceptions

        1.Unchecked 2.Checked

    - if it is occur during compile time it is Checked exceptions
    - if it is occur during run time it is Unchecked exceptions

    - Checked it needs to be handle immediately, otherwise you will be not able to compile your code
    - Unchecked it is only check when you run the code, so you are able to run
    - If you have exception, without handling it is going to crash your program

    To handle the exceptions we have: TRY-CATCH BLOCK
    - you declare both of them
    - exception code go to the try block
    - in the catch block you need to give exception type
    - Runtime exception is the parent of all the exceptions
    - You can multiple catch block;
        - There is only one rule: parent exception type can not be placed before the child exception type
    - Finally Block: it is optional, you need to give it at the end of catch blocks
        - It is always gets executed
        - The only way to stop it by giving explicitly System.exit(0) method.

    Final vs Finally vs Finalize
