    Collections FrameWork
    - Collection it consists of multiple interface, each interface is implemented by classes.
    - Collection is the root interface of the List, Queue and Set interface.
    - Collection is provider of the some useful methods.
    - It has dynmaic size
    - it has ready methods to use/apply
    - It does not allow the primitive types
    - Collection can be List, can be Set and can be Queue
    - the collection is extended by List, Set and Queue.
    - there are some classes that are implementing those interfaces

    List:
    - Duplicates are allowed
    - It has index number, because insertion order preserved order
    - It keeps insertion order
    ArrayList:
    - it is an array based class
    - it is faster for searching/accessing elements
    LinkedList:
    - it is known as doubly linked list, each element has a pointer to to the next element
    Vector:
    Stack:

    Set:
    - Duplicates are not allowed
    - it does not have index number
    - insertion order is not preserved
    - In set only one class does maintain the insertion order

    Queue:
    - Duplicates are allowed
    - it does not have index number
    - insertion order is not preserved
    - it has First-in first out order
