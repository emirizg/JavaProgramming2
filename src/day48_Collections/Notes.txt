    Data Structures: work with data
        Array
        Collection
        - it only supports non primitives type
        Map

    Array:
    - Size is fixed
    - support both primitives & non-primitives

    Collection:
    - Size is dynamic
    - It supports non-primitives ONLY

    List(interface): accepts duplicates, has index numbers
        ArrayList(class): internally uses array
            - accessing/retrieving the element is faster( get() )

        LinkedList(class): internally uses doubly linked list
            - adding/removing it is faster ( add() / remove() )

        Vector(class): internally uses array
            - is Synchronized == Thread-safe

        Stack(class):
            - it is a child of Vector
            - Last in first out order (LIFO)



    Set(interface): does not accept duplicates, does not have index
        HashSet (class):  order is random
        LinkedHashSet (class): keeps the insertion order as it is
        TreeSet (class): keeps the sorted order
            - does not accept null


    Queue(interface)


    Synchronized: one thread are being executed one thread at the time in multi-threading environment
        advantage: thread-safe
        disadvantage: it is slower

    Process: execution instance of a program
        - every single process in order to operate they need at least one thread

    Thread:
        - Process creates the thread
        - It is a sequence of execution within process

    Multi-threading:
        - two or more threads being executed within the process

    Multi-tasking:
        - two or more process are running


    Concurrently execution vs Parellely execution
        - Concurrently: --> 1000 * 5 ===> 5000 seconds ===> 10000 threads
            chrome browser (process)

        - Paralelly: --> 200 * 5 ===> 1000 seconds
            chrome browser1 (process) ===> 2000 threads
            chrome browser2 (process) ===> 2000 threads
            chrome browser3 (process) ===> 2000 threads
            chrome browser4 (process) ===> 2000 threads
            chrome browser5 (process) ===> 2000 threads
