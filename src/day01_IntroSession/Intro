    JDK => JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT
  --> JDK is basically a set of tools that are needed for writing the java source code and executing the java source code
  --> Instead of downloading them seperatly, we just download JDK that contains all the tools that are needed to write java
  source code and execute the java source code.
  --> It contains the tools and system libraries and the resources that are needed for java
  --> it is for java

  JRE => JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONAMNET
  --> It's a system library basicly, when you write your java source code, when you write any codes in java you need to use
  some keywords or classes or something that is something from java library
  --> This JRE is the one that is providing those resources for you, so you can use it to write your codes
  --> When you write your java codes there are specific keyword or specific syntax they all come from JRE
  --> Basicly JRE you can see as a library, the library that contains the resources that you can use

  JAVAC => JAVA COMPILER
  --> It is going to convert your source code to the byte code(it is has number basicly,those number are actually language
  that computer can understand, that's a code for the computer) Java compiler does the translation for the computer
  --> Java compiler is responsible for converting your source code whichever java source code to the byte-code
  Byte-Code: is the actual code that your computer able to read it, you can not read it, it has some number like 10010101

  JVM => JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE
  --> it is one that actually responsible for running your java codes, when you run any java codes
  you are going to get output eventually, and that output is deliverd by the java virtual machine.

  - The only code that computer understand is byte-code
  - Once byte-code is ready to run, the responsible for running it and delivering the output to your computer, it is JVM
  - This how java works    1.Source code --> 2.Java C compiler --> 3.Byte-code --> 4.JVM final output

  IDE => INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
  - (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities
    to computer programmers for software development.
